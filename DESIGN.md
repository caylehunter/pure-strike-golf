# Pure Strike — design notes

Working name. Arcade golf for phones: big, satisfying drives, a real handicap underneath, and match play with strokes ("pops") for the higher handicap.

## Guiding rule

**Every objective must be obvious. It doesn't have to be easy, but it has to be obvious.** The player should always be able to see what they are aiming for, and after a miss the game says why (early, late, cancelled).

## Swing (full shots)

1. **Aim:** drag on the course. The preview shows the flight path and carry, with the ring landing on the aim line even when the shot curves.
2. **Power: hold and release.** Hold Swing; the bar fills. Let go to set power. The red PIN mark shows the power that reaches the pin.
3. **Strike: tap when the rings meet.** A white ring closes on a gold circle in about 1.3 s (blue tees ~1.45 s, nuke ~1.2 s). The gold band's thickness is the perfect window. Early means slice (curves right), late means hook (curves left).

Feedback pops: PURE, A TOUCH EARLY/LATE, SLICE/HOOK (tapped early/late), HOLD TO POWER UP, SWING CANCELLED.

## Nuclear drive (black tees, driver, tee shot only)

- Arm **Nuke**. The power bar extends past the 100% line straight into the **NUKE band**, which is the top of the meter.
- The bar hangs at the top for 80 ms, so the band is one continuous window (~0.2 s at Lv 1).
- Let go in the band, then strike: **NUCLEAR** (~440–450 yd carry). A bad strike gives **MELTDOWN** (early: nuclear slice, late: nuclear hook).
- Let go before the band → TOO EARLY; after it → TOO LATE. Both still hit a normal drive.

### Upgrades (to become earned rewards)

| Upgrade | Lv 1 | Lv 2 | Lv 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nuke target (band width past 100%) | 0.06 | 0.09 | 0.13 |
| Swing tempo (meter + ring speed) | 1.0× | 0.84× | 0.70× |

## Shot shaping

Straight, Draw, Fade, Stinger. Stinger: low flight, less carry, more roll, 35% wind effect. Planned as ball-control rewards from hard courses.

## Putting

- The camera turns so the hole is always straight up; the ball sits in the lower-middle of the screen.
- **Pull down anywhere** and let go. A full pull rolls about **2.2× the distance to the hole + 1.5 yd** (4–25 yd), so short putts get the finest control.
- While pulling, a **gold circle with a feet label** shows where the ball stops **on flat ground**, and a top pill reads `PUTT X FT · HOLE Y FT` (green when within 1 ft). The player reads slope and adjusts.
- Green read options: **Off** (default) or **Slope** (contours plus downhill flow dots). The old "Line" mode was removed because it did the read for the player.
- Physics: stimp-like friction, slope gravity, cup capture with real lip-outs when too firm or off-center.

## Course and rules

- Hole 1: par 5, 555 yd (blue) / 616 yd (black), dogleg left, water right of the nuke landing zone.
- Rough −15%, bunker −30% (sand wedge −8%). Water: +1, drop at the edge. OB: +1, replay. Pick up at 12.
- Wind: blue 0–7 mph, black 4–15 mph.

## Roadmap

1. Repo + design doc + tests (this).
2. **The come-back-tomorrow loop:** 3-hole round (par 3, 4, 5), handicap that drops with good rounds, earned upgrades and milestones, black tees unlocked by handicap.
3. Match play vs. AI with handicap pops.
4. Art/audio pass, online match play, app-store packaging.
